### Neural Architecture Search (NAS) with Hardware-Aware Optimization

## Under construction:
simply added basic operations, hardware predictors and supernet. 
only torch used atm




## PENDING AND TO DOS: 
1. fix testing example for darts_searcher seems to be an issue with line53 - supernet.py
2. Visualizations should be saved and displayed. (PENDING!) 
3. Added Pareto Optimizr as well as evol-search and prog-search
